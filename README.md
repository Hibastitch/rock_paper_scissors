About the Game
This project is a classic implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the game will determine the winner against a random computer choice. Your score (wins, losses, and ties) is tracked and saved locally in your browser.

Features

Score Tracking: Keeps track of your wins, losses, and ties.
Local Storage: Your score is saved in your browser's local storage, so it persists even if you close the tab.
Responsive Design: A clean and simple interface for easy gameplay.
Visual Feedback: See your choice and the computer's choice visually after each round.
